# Multi-Modal Author Identification

This project implements a **multi-modal neural network** for author identification using both **audio** (voice recordings) and **text** (written transcripts). It combines **LSTM-based audio features** with **text embeddings** to classify authors.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to identify the author of a speech sample by analyzing **both voice and textual content**. This approach leverages:
- **MFCC features** from audio.
- **Word embeddings** from text sequences.
- **LSTM** for sequential audio features.
- **GlobalAveragePooling** for text embeddings.
